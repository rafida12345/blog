              <h2>she made me stronger</h2>
              <p>My mother, Lizzy, is ninety-seven, and I think of her as a survivor. Of life and time. Not long ago she had a mother, husband, sister and two daughters. Now she has me.

Twice a week I open the door to her house and look left, peering through the curtained darkness, along the hall and into her bedroom. I can see she is still sleeping. Under the formless camouflage of blankets, her shape has diminished and become frail, although her carers joke that she inhales each meal. They also say she is still stubborn, but in a cute way. She has passed the irritating cantankerousness of old age, and drifted without notice into the gentle humility of a disappearing mind.

There is not enough time in a day to see her more often, or so my private narrative goes, constructing a life so much more important, exciting, exasperatingly busy than it is.

              <h2>“Speak now!” I said to myself again.</h2>
            <div >
            <p>“Hello folks! My name is Ada Thomas. Thanks so much for joining me today!”

One year prior, on this same stage, I turned and walked off after my second ‘speak now’ prompt to myself. And that day was the second time I had done so in as many months. I vowed then to never put myself in such an embarrassing position again. No, not ever!

But here I 34was. And to my great surprise and delight, the auditorium was once again filled with lovely folks. Some, most certainly, curious to see if I would have a three-peat, some perhaps hoping to finally hear what they came for earlier or some possibly to cheer me on to finish what I came to do.

“It is my sincere hope that you will leave here today with a bit more than you brought with you. It is my sincere hope that I will do the same,” my voice is calm. I am calm.

I look around the room at all of the beautiful faces and imagine that each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. It is a connection that we have with our fellow humans.

“I’m thinking some of you were here one of those times last year when I took the stage to speak and left without saying a word. Some of you may have heard about it. Some of you, quite possibly, have no idea what I am referring to.”

I chuckle a bit because I am so comfortable. It is new to me. This relaxed, anxiety-free feeling.</p>

              <h2>Roads Not Taken</h2>
              <p>“In the middle of the journey of our life I came to myself within a dark wood where the straight path was lost.” Dante

“You okay?”

Driving, Anton glanced at his wife, Renee.

“Sure. Thinking. Why?”

“We’re not there yet. But you were slowing. You know, checking in.”

“It’s nothing… Well, it’s, you know.” She nodded. “Damn road is so dark. And, to be honest, I’m dreading this ‘reunion,’ tonight.”

“Why? These are your friends. High school, right?” He nodded. “You’ve known them longer than you’ve known me.”

“Don’t have much in common anymore. Different priorities. Life choices. Talk about diverging paths… I’d rather know you. Why don’t we get dinner and blow off this soiree?”

Renee went for it. “You know, Ant, I made some choices too.”

“Of course, Ree, I do know that. Everyone does. It’s a balance. And it isn’t just work. It’s… it’s…” His voice failed.

“That dream?”

              <h2>probably i was lucky</h2>
              <p>That morning, Anton awakened from fitful sleep in a cold sweat. His nightmare path into a dark forest ended abruptly. Pursued by what, he didn’t know, but he had no options. He woke up trying to breathe. He lay panicked and lost for an hour. The unshakable dread followed him all day.

Renee touched his arm. “You know, don’t you, those dreams are only in your head.”

His pent up emotions exploded in laughter. She joined with him.

“Yeah! I heard that once or twice.” He patted her knee. “Thanks…”

“This started on your birthday.” He nodded. “Why put so much weight on a random date? I don’t get it. What do you think would change if we told the twins they were born on different days, months apart?”

Eyes on the road, he nodded at the familiar refrain. Easier said than done.

Shifting gears, Anton said, “I hope it isn’t one of Chloe’s strolls down memory lane. High school memories… stupid baseball nostalgia. After twenty years? Spare me.”

He hadn’t played since college but still held an athlete’s look.

“I like hearing your adventures.”

“Or worse, she’ll have us all dancing naked around a bonfire, chanting to the goddess…” </p>

              <h2>My Mother's Dreams</h2>
              <p>In her dream she is fourteen, running home from work on precarious little heels, down the paved street, as molten metal plip-plops around her, dotting the cement with perfect silver discs. Her mother lags six feet behind, following her footsteps, urging her to tread carefully. A V2 rocket launches overhead, triggering the timer in her mind. She waits in the signature silence for the rocket to find its mark, as it careens noiselessly through the night sky.

“One,” she shouts, “Two. Three. Four.”

“We have plenty of time, Lizzy, plenty of time.” Her mother is shouting, over and over, no panic, just a calm, reassuring scream.

It is the same dream as always. Lizzy reaches behind and grabs the older woman’s hand, pulls her into the shelter of their porch, watching as the house across the road explodes into a heap of searing, flaming rubble.

              <h2>Letting go</h2>
              <p>I dedicate this story to my partner and to everyone who has carried or is carrying the burden of grief.

Sitting by the bed, holding my hand, you think my mind is fighting against the decision of my body to quit life’s game. My eyes are closed, but I sense your will through the fingers laced tightly around my own. Tenderness is a force and you stake my claim to life through the insistent pressure of your hand. How it has grown over these long years from its immaculate small perfection to this manifestation of adult capability: greeting strangers, shaking on deals, carrying children of your own. From the first moment, holding tight to my little finger in the hush of the darkened hospital room, it wanted to latch onto me and the world. You needed reassuring then; you do now. 

Beloved child, my hand rests peacefully in your own. Let it speak to you with the words I can no longer form: I am ready, so let me go. 

Quitting seems such a nasty word. I used to think so too. Lying here, I remember telling you not to give up; to keep trying at those school projects, at winning over the sour-faced teacher, at striving to do your best in the world of work and family. So, it is no surprise that you desperately want me to go another round; you aren’t ready for me to hang up the boots and to let this be the final whistle. 

Doctors speak in plain language of their expectations for this last round of play. You are resigned, seeming to concur with their prognosis; yet, when they are gone to the next ward, I feel the pulse of rage in the heartbeat of your hand. It troubles the peace I feel begin to slip about me like the blanket I wrapped you in, our blessed first night together.

Beloved child, tuck me into this long sleep. </p>
